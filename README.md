# Dice-Game
This Python code implements a dice game for 2 to 4 players. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die, accumulating scores. The goal is to be the first to reach or exceed 33 points. The game ends when a player achieves this target. The code uses random number generation and simple rules for player turns and scoring, with the winning player and score displayed at the end.
